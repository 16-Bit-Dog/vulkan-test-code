The project uses external models, textures, and the external librarys of vulkan 1.2, glm, glfw, stb_image and tiny_obj_loader


THIS PROJECT EXISTS AS PRACTICE BEFORE I TRY AND LEARN DX12 CODING; if it cannnot be derived from the few (of multiple) programs I posted... I love win32 api [AKA winapi] --> so I really wanted to do dx12... but resorces for vulkan were more plentiful. Now I will understand terms for DX 12 programming
